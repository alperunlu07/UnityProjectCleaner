# Unity Project Cleaner

Unity Project Cleaner is a Python script that helps Unity developers manage and clean up temporary files generated by Unity projects. It scans each project directory for folders like `Library`, `Logs`, `obj`, and `Temp` and flags them for deletion if they haven't been modified within a specified period. This tool is ideal for developers who want to optimize storage and remove unused files safely and efficiently.

## Features

- Checks the modification date of Unity's temporary folders (e.g., `Library`, `Logs`, `obj`, `Temp`).
- Lists all flagged folders and prompts for confirmation before deletion.
- Simple configuration of project path and file age threshold.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows 11 (although adaptable to other platforms)

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone this Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unity-project-cleaner.git
    cd unity-project-cleaner
    ```

2. **Set Up Python**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Configure the Script**:
   - Open the script `clean_unity_project.py` and update the `UNITY_PROJECTS_PATH` variable to point to your Unity projects directory.
   - Adjust the `DAYS_THRESHOLD` to specify the number of days after which a folder is marked for deletion.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python clean_unity_project.py


Checking project: C:/UnityProjects/MyGame
Marked for deletion: ['C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Library', 'C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Temp']

The following folders are marked for deletion:
- C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Library
- C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Temp

Do you want to delete these folders? (yes/no): yes

Deleting: C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Library
Deleting: C:/UnityProjects/MyGame/Temp
Deletion completed.
